========================

Conky config files suited for netbook screens

This repo contains conky config files and corresponding scripts for displaying the title, artist and album name as well as a progress bar for the current song in mocp (because the default conky mocp isn't cutting it for me). Also included is a script for a volume bar.

Usage:
Add the config files to ~/.conky
Add conky_start to your openbox (or some other wm) autostart.sh
